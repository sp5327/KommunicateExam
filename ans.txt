Q.4 
The best project that I have worked on my student detail web application where I used the CRUD application where anybody can create a field of details where anybody can update,create,delete and edit their detials which are stored in all user list component. 
I used material UI in React with node js as the backend.The database was uploaded on the mongoDB server. This was my first porject while learing react and I learned alot about React. 


The another project that i worked on was with my team where we fetched twitter api and used NLP to process our US Airline data. The project main idea was to use Sentimental analysis on 
our data that was fetched from Twitter and predict weather the reviews were of good, bad, or mixed reaction 
It helps the company to identify the sentimenets about the company in public forum such as twitter 
to better build their project

Rakshit - He is smart, very good at handling the situation at difficult time part and he is good listener 
Mansi - she is smart and always strives for the best
